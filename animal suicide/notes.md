I nodded and thought about all the years that Mom had raised me. All the pain. All the loneliness. What would have happened if I had succeeded on killing myself? She would have wasted all those years, and who knows---maybe she would have taken her own life. The thought made me cringe. However, I knew that if I went back in time, I would have thought the same thoughts and made the exact same decisions. Because the truth was, I couldn't be anyone but myself.

Put more references to punk bands?
