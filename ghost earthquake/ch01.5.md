"What?" Eri said, squinting at Yuki. "There was an earthquake last night?"

Yuki took a gulp of her vodka. "Yeah. Around eight. The news said it was a six. Sure you didn't feel it?"

Eri dove deep into her memory. Coming out blank, she shook her head.

"Weird," Yuki blurted. "Maybe you were sleeping?"

"Me, sleeping at eight?"

"Maybe you were sleeping with *someone*?" Yuki said with a teasing voice. "And didn't notice because of all the *shaking*?"

"Yuki, stop!" Eri snickered, nudging Yuki with her elbow. "There's people around."

"Okay, okay." Yuki raised both palms. "Maybe you felt the earthquake, and forgot about it?"

"How could I forget something like that?"

"You tell me ..."

"No, I don't think I forgot." Eri pressed a finger to her temple. "I *do* forget what I was doing, though."

"You don't remember anything?"

"I'm sure I was in my room."

Yuki let out a sigh. "You know, sometimes I wonder if your head is really down on earth."

"Yeah," Eri said with a serious smile. "I do, too."

Silence surrounded the table. Eri stared at her palm beneath the Heineken neon sign next to her. Its light made her hand look greenish, like that of a traveler from a far away civilization.

Yuki waved to the waitress and asked for another of the same. Then she turned back to Eri and said, "Hey. Forgot to tell you. I finally got my visa."

"Oh, that’s great!" Eri said. "So when did you say you're going? Next year?"

"Next month."

"Oh, yeah." Eri laughed. "Sorry, I'm not sure what's with my memory tonight." She noticed Yuki looking down at the table. "What's wrong?"

Yuki wrinkled her dark brows. "To tell the truth, I'm not sure if I should go or not."

"C'mon, you're just afraid. That's normal. It's your first time abroad."

"It's not that," Yuki said.

"Then what is it?" Eri asked.

"At first the whole idea seemed very exciting to me. But now, I don't know if it really makes sense. Like, why am I so crazy about the US anyway? My life isn't going to change because of studying in the most imperialist country on Earth."

"You'll never find out if you don't try." Eri sipped her Bloody Mary and frowned at the glass. Too strong. "The idea is to experience something first, and decide if it makes sense later."

"Wow," Yuki said mockingly. "When did you become so wise?"

"You mean I never was?"

"Nah," Yuki said, smirking. "You've always been the same."

The waitress came back with Yuki's order, placed it on the table, and walked away. She did all this mechanically, as if on autopilot.

"How 'bout you?" Yuki asked. "Still not thinking of leaving the country?"

"Not really," Eri replied. "And it's not that I’m against traveling or studying abroad. It's just that I'm not against staying where I am either."

"Eri, always so adventurous."

"Who said life has to be an adventure?"

"No one," Yuki took off her jacket, turned around, and dressed her chair with it. Now she exhibited her black tank top. "But I don't know, don't you feel like talking a break from it sometimes?"

"I think you have to build your life in such a way that you don't feel like taking a break from it."

"You think I'm escaping from something?"

Eri shook her head. "I didn't mean that. Actually, I think you're good at dealing with problems."

Yuki smiled, as though looking at a old high-school photo. "You think you can handle yours after I'm gone?"

Eri nodded. "As well as always."

"What 'bout you?" Yuki asked. "Are you going to be *well*?"

"I'll be okay." Eri fiddled with her cone-shaped glass. "It'll be boring without you, though."

"Guess you'll have more time to spend with Takeshi."

"Yeah, now that you mention it, we haven't spent much time together."

"That's how relationships are." Yuki popped a peanut into her mouth. "Everything's exciting and magical at the beginning. Love letters, late night calls. But after a few years, you become so fed up with each other you rather kiss a stranger."

Eri chuckled. "Just because there's no more romance, doesn't mean love is over. It just means the couple reached that comfortable zone."

"So you and Takeshi are in this zone?"

"Yeah---at least I feel comfortable."

"How 'bout him?" Yuki asked.

"I think he feels the same." Eri sipped her drink, finishing half of it. "At least he haven't complained about anything."

"Not complaining also means not caring."

Eri frowned. "You think there's something wrong with Takeshi. Don't you?"

"Nah," Yuki said. "Just making sure everything's okay between you."

"Any evidence to suggest the contrary?"

"The Second Law of Thermodynamics."

"What?" Eri blinked at Yuki. Her friend often came up with eccentric explanations like these.

"Remember it? The law says, the natural tendency of things is to become messier and messier."

"Stop that," Eri said, dragging out the last word. "Not everything you learn in school is applicable to real life."

"Science *always* is."

Eri sipped her drink . "I meant between Takeshi and I. Human relationships."

"That's chemistry---but never mind." Yuki placed her hand on Eri's. It felt hot, like burning coal. "Maybe I'm just worried because I'm leaving the country. Leaving you."

"Oh, don't be." Eri placed her other hand on the little mountain of hands. "Nothing will happen. Everything'll be the same when you come back."

Yuki smiled. "Do your best to keep your life glued together."

Eri smiled back. "Do the same with the one that's awaiting you."

They continued talking quietly, mainly reminiscing about the old times. Eri wondered how many more times she'd be able to come with Yuki to this bar. They'd been coming since college, so it was almost like their second home. It never occurred to Eri that they would stop one day. She was convinced they would keep doing it forever, like two neighboring stars meeting every night in the sky.

After finishing their drinks, Yuki gave Eri a ride to the entrance to the subway. They agreed to meet next week, and Yuki drove away on her motorcycle.

Eri watched Yuki as she disappeared between the ocean of motorcycles and smoke-belching cars. A strange sensation surrounded her. She felt as if gravity had changed, though unsure whether she felt heavier or lighter. She knew only one thing: her body wasn't used to this new adjustment.

Eri gave her head a shake. *I had too many drinks*, she thought. *The alcohol's doing funny stuff to my brain*. Slinging her purse over her shoulder, she turned around, and descended the escalator.

* * *

Eri lowered her pen to the blank page and wrote a first verse, followed by a second. She examined each word carefully, then closed her notebook with a sigh.

Becoming a poet wasn't something Eri had in mind. Writing poems was just a way to put her thoughts in order. Once turned into ink, they became something tangible; something she could cut, arrange and rearrange until it had a clear, definite shape. And the process was always smooth and natural. Like a river flowing calmly into the ocean.

But tonight, Eri couldn't concentrate---words felt out of place, and rhymes ended up sounding flat and dull. Giving up, she rose from the table and went to sit at her leather sofa. Then, catching sight of the remote on the table, she grabbed it and switched on the local news.

4 killed, 8 injured in chain highway crash. Drunk man hit a 65-year-old woman on the sidewalk. She died on the spot. Eri frowned and switched to next station. 4 police officers investigated for corruption, 2 praised for performance. Unemployment rate rises to 6% in August. Rain possible over the weekend.

Eri clicked the TV off, and sank back on the sofa. "No news about the earthquake."

Eri's eyes scanned the room, stopping at the bookshelf. She went over to it and, as if she were searching for a secret passage, she examined each of the books. They were perfectly aligned side by side. Not the slightest trace of movement in them. Even the dust was in its usual place. Eri wondered whether Yuki had told her the earthquake thing as a joke. But why would she do that? Besides, Eri knew Yuki very well; she would never joke with issues like these.

It occurred to Eri to check her room. Her first impulse was to go over to the pile of empty cans she kept in the desk shelf. Two rows of Asahi cocktails of practically all flavors. Eri had no idea why she kept them; the thing was a mystery even to herself. She brought one home one day and drank it in her room. But when she was about to throw it to the garbage, she looked at the empty shelf on her desk, and decided to put it there. She'd never figured out what it was for, anyway. Well, maybe that's why it's there, she thought. To put empty cocktail cans. Many others joined the collection after that.

Like the books, the cans hadn't moved a single inch. Eri found this strange. Even the tiniest shaking would have been enough to move them. Aluminum was as light as feather after all.

Eri heaved a sigh. She decided to stop thinking about the whole matter. She'd been thinking too much recently, which had never done her any good. What she needed now was to talk with someone. Hear a human voice. That would probably bring her mind back to earth.

On her room again, she fished out her phone from her red backpack, scrolled through her contacts, and pressed the call button. The phone rang one, two, three ... eight time until her boyfriend picked up.

"Busy?" Eri sat on the edge of her bed, her legs crossed.

"No," Takeshi said. "I was just---telling something to a co-worker. Something about work."

"It's nine p.m. ..."

"Jobs don't have schedules these days."

"Yeah, never mind." Fearing they would feel asleep, Eri shifted the position of her legs. "Want me to come over tonight?"

"Sure," Takeshi said. "It's always nice to have you over."

"It's not too late?"

"Love doesn't have schedule, either," Takeshi said flirtatiously.

Eri smiled and agreed to meet him at his apartment in ten minutes. He could have picked her up, but his apartment was just two blocks away. Not dangerous for a woman. Well, at least according to Takeshi.

Not wanting to be late, Eri slipped on her orange hoodie, shouldered her red backpack, snatched her keys from the table. Ready to go. While closing the door of her room, she looked at the mirror of the wardrobe.

She'd forgotten the makeup. Not that she had become careless about her appearance, but she'd only been meeting De-Shi at his apartment, lately. Besides, because of the tiny drops of Dutch blood that ran through her veins, she had long eyelashes and plump red lips. Which made her look as if she had makeup on. And since her hair was super smooth and straight---a trait she had inherited from her mother---she rarely had to brush it. Very convenient.

Finally, Eri opened the front door. Then, taking a look at her apartment one last time, she started down the hallway.
"What?" Eri said, squinting at Yuki. "There was an earthquake last night?"

Yuki took a gulp of her vodka. "Yeah. Around eight. The news said it was a six. Sure you didn't feel it?"

Eri dove deep into her memory, but came out blank. She shook her head.

"No way," Yuki blurted. "It was a pretty strong one. Maybe you were sleeping?"

"Sleeping at eight?"

"Maybe you were sleeping with *someone*?" Yuki said with a teasing voice. "And didn't notice because of all the movement?"

"Yuki, stop!" Eri snickered, pushing Yuki softly. "There's people around."

"Okay, okay." Yuki raised her palms. "So, maybe you felt the earthquake, but forgot about it?"

"How can someone forget something like that?"

"You tell me ..."

"No, I don't think I forgot---I *do* forget what I was doing, though."

Yuki let out a sigh. "You know, sometimes I wonder if your head is really down on earth."

"Yeah." Eri pressed a finger softly to her temple. "Sometimes I wonder, too."

They fell silent for a while. Eri stared at her palm beneath the Heineken neon sign next to her. Its light made her hand look greenish, like that of a traveler from a far away civilization.

Yuki waved to the waitress and asked for another of the same. Then she turned back to Eri and said, "Hey. Forgot to tell you. I finally got my visa."

Yuki wrinkled her dark brows. "Tell the truth, I'm not sure if I should go or not."

"Come on, you're just afraid. That's normal. It's your first time abroad."

"Well, at first the whole idea seemed very exciting to me. But now, I don't know, I'm starting to wonder whether this really makes sense. Like, why am I so crazy about the US anyway? My life isn't going to change because of studying in the most imperialist country on Earth."

"So adventurous," Yuki said sarcastically.

"Who said life has to be an adventure?"

"Guess no one," Yuki took off her jacket, turned around, and dressed her chair with it. Now she exhibited her black tank top. "But I don't know, don't you feel like talking a break from it?"

"That's how relationships are." Yuki popped a peanut into her mouth. "Everything's exciting and magical at the beginning. Love letters, late night calls. But after a few years, you don't wanna see each other's faces anymore, not even in a cute photo frame."

Eri chuckled. "Just because there's no more romantic stuff, doesn't mean love is over. It just means the couple reached that comfortable zone."

"So you and Takeshi are in this *comfortable* zone?"

"Yeah---at least I feel comfortable."

"How 'bout him?" Yuki asked.

"The law says, the natural tendency of things is to become more and more messy."

"C'mon," Eri said. "Not everything you learn in class is applicable to real life."

"Chemistry *is* applicable to real life."

"Anyway." Eri sipped her drink again. "What I mean is, ."

"Yeah, maybe you're right." Yuki placed her hand on Eri's. It felt hot, like burning coal. "Maybe I'm just worried. You know, I'm leaving the country, leaving you."

"Oh, don't worry." Eri placed her other hand on top of the small mountain. "Things don't fall apart overnight. You'll see. Everything will be the same when you come back."

Yuki smiled. "Do your best to keep your life glued together."

Eri smiled back. "Do the same with the one that's awaiting you."

They continued talking quietly, mainly reminiscing about the old times. Eri wondered how many more times she'd be able to come with Yuki to this bar.

She had forgotten to apply make up on herself. Not that she had become careless about her appearance. But lately she had only been meeting De-Shi at his apartment. No need to look stunning. Besides, because of the tiny drops of Dutch blood that ran through her veins, she had long eyelashes and plump red lips. Which made her look as if she had make up on, anyways. And since her hair was super straight and smooth---something she had inherited from her mother---she practically never had to brush it. It would be like brushing silk. Very convenient.

With this thought, Eri closed the door of the room, opened the front one, and exited her apartment.
