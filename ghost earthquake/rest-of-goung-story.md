Eri nodded, impressed and happy for Goung. How he had gone from being a homeless guy with nothing to eat to a successful real estate agent.

"Wait," Eri said, holding her bottle of crystaline water. "So this happened about the time he disappeared. How when did De-Shi disappear? Why are you using his email?"

"Oh, I'm sorry." Goung offered Eri a sitting bow. "I always get carried away with this tale. Sometimes I wonder if I'm sitting there waiting for the oportunity to tell it. Anyway, Exactly two years after I started working here---that is, twow weeks from now, De-Shi started taking leave more and more often. Which was shoking since he hadn't taken a single day of in the four years that he had been working in the agency. At first they were just once a week. They suddenly became twice, three---until he started taking whole weeks off---saying that he had caugh the flu---which no one doubted since he looked like *really* like a sick man. He eyes became red, lost some hair, and became even thinner than he already was. I had seen zombies more healthy-looking than him.

Eri stared at Goung shocked. "So did you find out what happened to him."

The man shook his head. "Before we could, De-Shi stopped coming to the office. He didn't resign or even give a call. He just *stopped* coming. And no one knew where he was or even if he was still alive."

Eri looked at his still shocked. "You should have called the police."

"We did," Guong said. "But since he had cut ties with his family it was hard to file a missing person ourselves. We couldn't do it. And there wasn't any evidence that De-Shi had been kidnapped or had suffered any accident. Thousands of people ran away like this---you know after getting sick at work or something like that---and escape from work and life."

"And---that's what you think what happened?"

Goung shook his head. "I knew De-Shi very well, he was my best and only friend. Who took me out of poverty. The guy would have been the last person to quit Shin-Yi. He was the most passionate photographer that we had here. I assume you know what you know what I'm talking about since you have seen his blog. He would sometimes even stay after work inside those houses and building taking the right angle with just the right amount of lighting and feeling before he even went back home. Sometimes he would even spend the whole night in those empty apartments---up until sunrise and then just sleep there."

"So," Eri said, "What did you do then?"

"I did what the last option that I had: to call a private eye. One of the best in the city. I told him all this thing that I'm telling you right now and he promised he would do his best to find something about De-Shi---but it had been already two weeks and the guy hasn't found anything yet."

"So---maybe he left the city or something. Maybe he *really* wanted escape from life."

Guong stared at Eri serious for a moment, and for a momen she could see the Golem emerging again from his dark eyes. "I know this might sound crazy---but I've known the guy for a long time. And I practically know every kind of sickness---both in the mind and body---that he could possibly have. What I think is that he became obsessed by *something*. Or this something got his obsessed, seduced."

"Something?" Eri echoed with a frown. "You mean something like---supernatual?"

Guong shook his head. "Tell the truth, I'm not a supersticious person. Call me old fashioned---or I should say new-fashioned. But I've never believed in magic or witchcraft. One, because I've never seen any instance or proof. Not a single one. Second, because if these things were real you'd have the big and corrupt corporations exploiting them for their profit. They are smart. But once again, you have zero of that."

Eri nodded, thinking that Guong's explanation made more or less sense.

"So, I don't know, what this *thing* is. I'm not sure if it's a person or a hobby or something that De-Shi found in the basement or discovered my following a treasure chest. I just know that it was strong enough to stop him from his job. Strong enough from stopping him from this life-long passion of photography."

Eri nodded, perplexed, thinking about what this *thing* could have been. Could it have been the---

"Hey, I heard the secreary talk about a---girl," Eri said. "Maybe she is this *thing*?"

Goung shook his big head. "As I told you, De-Shi never had a girlfriend. Don't get me wrong---he wasn't gay. You can see these things between best friends. The thing was, he wasn't *crazy* about women. This was maybe because of how busy he was with his work and his passion for photography. He just didn't have enough energy to focus somewhere else. Or who knows, maybe he just thought that having a girlfriend was just a drag."

Eri nodded, wondering if she was a drag for Takeshi. "But did you meet this woman?"

Goung shook his head, making Eri wonder if he was already feeling dizzy for shaking it so much. "He mentioned her to me once. He referred to her as the *neighbor girl*. Just that. Not good neighbor. Cute neighbor. But that was that, he never talked about her and I had forgetten to ask---why? You think she's somehow involved in this?"

Eri massaged her temples. "No, I really don't know. You knew De-Shi more than I. Besides, you said he wasn't crazy about women. It's just that I said ..."

Goung nodded. "Oh, so that's why the secretary said that you were *that* girl.  You said yes that you were her when she secretary asked you. That's why she made such a strong impression in you."

Eri nodded. "Sorry I had to lie. But you didn't give me a better arrangement."

"I apologize very much about that." Goung gave Eri a small bow. "But just like I hired a detective---someone else---maybe someone in the company---hired a detective to spy on me. You know, being an ex-homeless man who had assaulted the very man who gave him a job isn't a very good record. And even though I was well-recieved here---there were still a few people who didn't like the idea that I guy like me would be here to stain their company. So they have been doing all they could all these years to kick me out. And this seems like their best chance so they are using everything they can."

Guong glanced around as if making sure that that detective wasn't listening to us talking about him.

"That why I don't use any social media or email nowadays. You can't trust it. You could upload an innocent picture or tell your location and the next thing you know, you're being listen to the goverment or a private detective. I know because the detective to ahold of some of my information that way. That's why I don't use it and when I do. I try to be as discreet as possible, give as less information as possible. I figured if what you wanted was important enough for you, you would come anyway. And you did. This earthquake project of yours must be very important."

Eri nodded at the man. "Yes, it's very important. I---feel like my life has come to a stop and that I can't continued it if I don't finish this."

Goung laughed. "That reminds me of De-Shi. He used to said stuff like this. To him, his passion was everything. No, I should say love. So in love with something that you forget about the world, forget about failure and the fear of failing."

Eri nodded, wondering if the same could have been said about this *project* she was having. It was fear which was triggering this hunt. Fear of what she had no idea. She remembered having remembered it. But now she wasn't very sure anymore. Her memory was really starting to get bad. She was forgetting even her feelings.

"Well," Goung said finally standing up. "I guess I've told you everything. Is there something that's still unclear?"

Eri gave him a quick nod. "Why are you telling me all this? "I mean, I'm practically a stranger to you."

"Yes, that correct." Guong said rubbing his neately-razored stubble in his chin. "I don't know, just like De-Shi trusted in me suddenly in that alley three years ago---I trusted on you. Maybe the thing is contagious. Or I don't know, maybe I just wanted to pay back that act of generosity with someone else---since I could never pay it back to De-Shi."

Eri nodded. "Don't worry, I'm sure you'll find De-Shi."

"I hope," Guong said. "You know, I'm not a sentimental person. Hell---in a Hulk like me that would look embarrasing. But De-Shi is a very important person to me. He literally saved my life---in the same minute I could have taken his. He became my best and only friend, who literarily pulled me out from the streets.

"But you know, what I appreciate the most---more than the job and the money---was that De-Shi taugh me the importance of having a home. I'm not talking about the physical part---the walls, the roof, the floor---but the place where you can come back to. Where you feel safe. Where you feel yourself. It's the place you come back when you are wounded, broken heart. Kicked. Defeated. But that doesn't matter. Because no matter what, you still have that home. And you can always go back to it. It only belongs to you."

Eri nodde at Goung, letting his words seep into the folds of her mind. Of her heart. She had never thought about this. She had always taken her house for granted---to the point she hadn't even thought about it. She hadn't thought *I have a home.* Maybe for a very long time. She promised herself that she would for now on. She would appreaciate every second that she had a roof above her head.

And that was how Eri finished her meeting with Goung. At Shin-Yi Real Estate Agency. She felt good. At sharing something about the earthquake---although somehow indirect---with somebody else. She felt as though she belonged more to earth, more to the city. They exchanged numbers and Guong promised Eri that he would update her if he found anything about De-Shi. Eri promised to call too to check about the progress.

And with that Eri said goodbye to Guong, who was supposed to go back to work and exited the room. She waved goodbye to the woman who was still smiling at her and exited Shin-Yi Real Estate Agency.
