They went to a cafe called Little London, which looked more like a bar in daylight than a cafe. It was dark and featured a bar at the back, a dart board, and posters of London bands from the 80s. Despite this, and despite the situation Eri found it to be a nice place---the faded green and red neon lights---the soft rock music in the background. When had been the last time Takeshi and she had come to a place like this? She couldn't wasn't sure; she just knew that they had once done it but she couldn't pin out the date.

"So you're right," the man said holding the pint he'd got himself. Eri couldn't believe someone could drink at eleven in the morning. Well, not that it was forbidden. "We worked together here as you may have deduced. We were both filming here and taking photography in this weeding firm. I know, you may be wondering and this hulk taking pictures of weeding? But well, I'm good at it. And the pay isn't bad. Sometimes it's the job that chooses you not you who choose the job. But anyway." The man stared around as though trying to hide something.

"It was the same for De-Shi the man is one of our best camera men in the company, no the guy was *born* for it. The camera is like an extra appendage or an extension of his eyes. The guy is able to capture the sadness, the happiness of every moment. Every second. That's why I appreciate him so much. And why he's so respected in the company.

Eri stared at the man for a moment,  cupping her cappuccino, wondering where he was getting at.

"Okay, okay enough of work stuff. Let's get into the point." The man glanced around nervously again. "So what happens is, De-Shi hasn't been coming to work for already two weeks. And that's sort of strange since the guy hadn't skipped work since he joined the company. So you could say that it's more than unusual.

"I don't understand," Eri said. "Then why don't you go see him? You should know where he lives right?"

"Yeah, your assumption is correct," the man dried his forehead with the back of his hand. He seemed a bit uneasy.

"So why don't you go look for him?" Eri was starting to become uneasy too.

"Well, the thing is, we've having some *personal* problems recently. So he won't answer my calls, nor open the door for me. So I can't be sure whether he's actually alright or evading me.

"What kind of *personal* problem if it's not too much to ask?" Eri asked.

"Well, it's the usual cliche. A woman. Things got mixed up and ... well, it's complicated."

Eri nodded. "Relationship problems are always complicated."

The man nodded with a sheepish smile. "Seems like you know a lot about these things."

Eri thought about it.

"And you're still worried about him even with this *personal problem?"

The man nodded. "Of course, problems don't end friendship---they only end when you stop trying to solve them. Same for relationships."

Eri nodded. "So if I'm not mistaken you want me to check De-Shi for you?"

The man nodded and sipped his beer. "I guess *want* isn't the correct word. I'm just *proposing* to you that you could do me that favor and in turn you may find what you are looking for too. Besides, I'm pretty sure he's more likely to receive a pretty lady like you."

Eri stared at he glass and smiled. I'd been a long since someone had complimented her.

"Well, not really," Eri replied trying to think whether she should tell him or not. No, he would think she was crazy. She couldn't tell anybody about this. She was she only person that could know.ented her like this. "Okay, I'll do it. So what's the address?"

Eri stood in front of a conventional apartment---so normal if it was demolished by a bulldozer no one would have noticed. Gray walls, blurry dark windows. And Eri knew that the people living inside equally conventional like the apartment. Maybe even *her* was conventional like that.

Eri stared at the direction that the man had given her again---no doubt she was in the right place.

Taking a deep breath, Eri put the address back into her pocket and made her way up the moss-covered steps. *This is crazy*, she thought to herself but she was already here, there was no use in turning around and going back. Besides, she had promised the man that she could take a look. Now it wasn't just about her anymore.

Eri walked through the gate and went straight to the main door trying to avoid the guard.

"Hey, there miss," he said.

*Dammit*. Eri turned slowly around trying to stay relaxed.

"Who are you looking for? I haven't seen you around here before." He was a balding man around his forties. A big smile, though it looked kind of fake.

"I'm ..." Eri stuttered. "I'm here to see De-Shi Tsai."

"You are his ..."

Eri wanted to say, *are you asking because it's your job or because you don't have any to do?* But at the end, she managed to keep calm. If she blew it, she'd probably not have another chance.

"I'm Ire, his ... his cousin."

"Cousin?" the balding man said to Eri with a sheepish look, checking her around. "I didn't know De-Shi had a cousin, and he's living here for a very long time."

"Well, actually I'm his ... girlfriend."

"Cousin-girlfriend?"

"No well ... I ..." Eri covered her face. Damn. She had blown it. She had always been terrible at lying---the more she lied the more she revealed the truth of her intentions.

The guard stared at her suspiciously for a moment. And then suddenly he bust out laughing. "That's funny, because De-Shi doesn't have a girlfriend."

Eri swallowed. Damn. "And how do you know? Who are---"

"I'm his best friend," the man said still looking at her. Matter-of-factly.

"Oh," Eri said wondering what to do next. But what could she do?

"So you know De-Shi?" the man finally asked.

"Well, no," Eri said stepping a few steps back. "But I'm ... looking for him."

"No need to worry or lie miss," the man suddenly relaxed his manners. This made Eri relax too. "Just tell me the real reason you're looking for him. I'm looking for him myself."

Eri thought a little about this while fiddling with her expresso. Should she tell the man about the whole thing? No, but the man would probably think that Eri was crazy. Hell, even *she* thought she was crazy herself.

However, Eri finally decided to tell the truth.

"Well, I saw his blog that he posted ... the blog he has about photography and recordings. And ... I came to get one of the recordings that he said that he was going to post but that later didn't." Well, at least part of the truth.

"I see," the man said, "Well, I won't ask further." He didn't seem very interested in Eri's video and she was glad that that was the case.

"So why were you looking for him," Eri suddenly asked, shy. "If it isn't much intrusion."

"That's all right," the man said, "intrusion if good from time to time it gets you to know people better." The man took a sip of his beer. "The reason I'm looking for De-Shi is that I can't find him."

Eri stared at the man for a moment confused. "Sorry, but I don't follow."

The man took a sip of his drink and then looked a Eri serious for a moment.

"De-Shi---he disappeared," he finally said.

"What?" Eri said almost knocking down her espresso. "What do you mean?"

"That, he disappeared," he man said making a *puff* movement with his hands.

"How? For how long---?" Eri started.

The man glanced around. "Look, I'll tell you just because you're the first person that I know who's interested in De-Shi but promise me that what it is said here stays here."

Eri nodded at the man. "I promise."

The man gave her a nod of confirmation.

"So roughly a month ago, De-Shi started to call in sick and not coming to work. At first he only did it once a week but when that one became two and that two became three until he wasn't coming to work anymore ... saying that he had to take leave because of a *medical issue*?"

Eri stared at the man shocked. "And that *medical issue* was true?"

The man shook his head staring at his glass. "I think it was bullshit. De-Shi had never had any medical condition or anything like that. I've known him for four years and I haven't seen him once sick. The guy is thin and might look a bit lanky but the guy had better immunity than a bull."

The man stopped for a moment and then continued.

"I had to admit, though that he *did* look sick looking those last days."

Eri squinted at him. "What so he *was* sick?"

The man shook his head. "No, I doubt it was a sickness. He just *looked* sick. He would come to work and be almost speechless and have his eyes red and with black bags as though he hadn't eaten anything at all. And then he looked very thin as though he hadn't eaten or slept anything at all."

Eri squinted again. "What do you think may be the cause?"

"I don't know---what I suspect is that he was *doing* something those last days that he was seeing or being *obsessed* by something---something that made him stay late at night so that he didn't sleep or eat and that's why skipped work."

Eri thought about this for a moment and wondered what this *thing* could have been. "And he didn't tell anything to anyone ... or you?"

The man shook his head. "When I asked him he would just brush out the matter and say that he was just *sick*. That he had caught the flu or something like that. I insisted of course but finally give up after he refused to tell me so many times. And then he disappeared so I couldn't ask him anymore.

"The bear---I mean the secretary told me that he talked about a girl. Maybe she had something to do with this?"

The man looked at Eri. One thing she had realized about him was that his expression was completely indecipherable. She might as well been looking for expression on a wall. "Oh, yeah. He mentioned her a few times. He said he had been seeing a girl in the night. The way he said it though it didn't sound like he was dating her or anything---more like watching her. But anyway, I don't think that's the thing. The man was never crazy about women, in fact, the guy never dated. He always cared more about this camera and recordings and photos---wait, is there the possibility that *you* are this girl?"

Eri shook her head. "No, sorry I'm not."

"I see," the man said disappointed. "Too bad, that would shed light to some things."

"So what now?" Eri asked. "What are you planning to do about De-Shi?"

The man said, "If De-Shi doesn't appear in a week, I'll call a private detective. I know it's not of my business if he doesn't want to work or show up but I'm really worried about him. He could be hurt or something like that."

"How about his family?" Eri asked. "Haven't they called the police or something.

"De-Shi was never close to his family. He was adopted and never really bonded with his steps parents. At the end they gave up and haven't talked with each other in years. They couldn't care less if De-Shi went missing or not."

"So you don't have a hunch of where he could be?"

"The man shook his head. "I already looked everywhere ... but trust me---he is nowhere to be found. Saying *anywhere* wouldn't be an exaggeration."

"I see," Eri said fiddling with her glass. "So would you tell me something if you find out something about De-Shi? Or the detective finds out?"

"Sure miss," the man said. "I'll give you my number."

The man gave Eri's his number and Eri recorded it on her phone. Ming. Eri saved the contact well---she might need it someday she thought.

As Eri left the bar and make sure that Ming had gone in his motorcycle she pulled down her red backpack and fiddled inside and pulled out the video. Now she felt guilty about not having told Ming about it---but she feared that he would snatch the video from her or something like that---even though it sounded improbable. But she couldn't have taken the risk.

As she continued watching the camera, Eri wondered if the video had something to do with that had happened to De-Shi. His *sick* looks. And if something inside the video would reveal that.
