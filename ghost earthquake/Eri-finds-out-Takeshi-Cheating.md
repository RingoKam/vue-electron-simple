Before she could open Google and search for the earthquake, though, she noticed the open tab---Takeshi's messenger---he had forgotten to logout---he always did but because he had probably been in a hurry in the morning he had perhaps forgotten about it.

Eri never questioned why Takeshi logged out. It was normal actually. You need privacy even in relationships. You need space.

And Eri would respect that space. Would she?

Eri stared at the login button for a moment her heart beating. She had contradictory thoughts. On one hand, she wanted to look but on the other not not just to respect Takeshi but because she feared what she would see. If she didn't open it it would be alright; she wouldn't see anything even if *there was*. But on the other hand, if there was *something* and she didn't see it she would miss seeing it. *Ah! What a contradictory thought*.

Well, if Takeshi didn't find out it would be as if it never happened isn't it? Besides, what would be the problem if he had nothing to hide? And if he had something to hide, when Eri had the right to check wasn't it?

Finally, with a gulp, and glancing around to make sure she was alone in the apartment, Eri clicked the login button and swallowed.

The first messages were just Takeshi and a few of his friends---guys that Eri knew but haven't really known or talked to.

The second were of his boss, probably telling him about some broken refrigerator or something like that.

The third was a girl---one that Eri had never seen before. She had long-messy hair almost like an Afro. And big blue contact lens that made her look a bit Alien-like.

Despite that she looked cute---those girls who guys drool to in magazines. Guys like ...

Takeshi?

With he heart beating ten thousand miles per minute, Eri clicked the white window of the conversation. At first she couldn't make herself to read it; she tried to skim so fast so that the words wouldn't reach her mind---but soon her courage---or curiosity?---won and she began reading the exchange.

Kaoru: So you finished with everything?
Takeshi: Yeah, kinda.
Kaoru: Okay, so you can leave at any time
Takeshi: Well, there's still some stuff I have to take care of.
Kaoru: Really? Alright but don't take long. Can't wait forever, you know.
Takeshi: Yeah, don't worry it'll just be for a little while more.
Kaoru: Okay.

Eri scrolled down until the the window bounced at the bottom of the window. There was no more conversation.

Eri slumped back on the sofa and stared at the white glowing screen as if in a trance, afraid to move, and even to breath.

Or could she be wrong? Could that had been just a friendly exchange about something else completely unrelated? No, the time was eleven a.m. what kind of friends text to each other at that time?

Eri let out a sigh. So Takeshi was cheating---and planning to leave her.

And who was this Kaoru? The new waitress? Yes! That was who she was. She definitely looked like a waitress---a slut waitress.

Eri slumped back on the sofa and covered her face on her hands. Why? Why did Takeshi want to leave her? There was nothing wrong between them. They had a stable relationship and hardly fought---she couldn't even remember the last time that they did. Their sex was okay too. Then what?

Or maybe things were simpler: Takeshi had just gotten tired of her. Didn't that happen to most men? They got tired of your body, your mind. Everything about you. What they wanted is something fresh, something new, something younger.

Eri covered her face on her hands and felt her head fell dizzy and as if everything around her were spinning.

Eri watched Takeshi as he navigated around the semi-dark kitchen making himself a beef spicy instant noodle---the usual thing that he ate when he came back late from work---if it was work at all.

Eri stared at the back of Takeshi's Green Day's T-shirt while the steam floated into the air and disappearing in mid-air in to the darkness, the darkness that surrounded the kitchen and all the apartment.

"Sorry I was late again," Takeshi said without turning around, stirring the boiling noodles.

"That's alright," Eri said, "It's become normal."

Takeshi finally turned around leaving the boiling steam rise on his dark background. "What? Me coming late?"

Eri nodded. "It's become normal you coming back at abnormal times."

Takeshi put down the chopsticks back into the pot and with a smile he slumped himself next to Eri into the sofa. "Guess that's right. Once the abnormal becomes more usual than the normal it becomes the normal." He wrapped carefully his arm around Eri, in that soft but masculine way he had. "But c'mon. Tell me what's happening."

Eri was still with her heart beating of rage---but Takeshi hadn't acted so concerned and---well, boyfriend-like---that she felt her defenses give up. Damn. Was was she so soft and manipulable?

"No, it's nothing," Eri said turning to the other side.

"When women say it's nothing it's always something," Takeshi said.

"That's a cliche," Eri replied.

"Just because it's a cliche it doesn't mean it isn't real," Takeshi said. " Besides cliches become cliches exactly because of that: they happen very often."

"Well the problem is a cliche too," Eri blurted out without thinking much.

Takeshi blinked at her for a moment, considering her words like a hunter listening to the found of a deer. "C'mon, the sooner you tell me the sooner we can solve this. The later you tell me the later we will fix it."

"This can't be fixed," Eri said dryly.

"At least you can let me try," Takeshi said still wrapped around her neck, caressing the side of her neck like he always did.

Eri stared at her boyfriend for a moment---wondering if he deserved a chance---wondering if she would miss her chance and regret not having giving him a chance. Damn. She always lost.

Eri turned to the side again. "Remember when you told me I could always use your laptop?"

"Let me guess you saw something you didn't like ..."

Eri turned to Takeshi, half expectant half surprised. "Well, something like ..."

"I promise I'll delete that porn collection ... I'm not interested in that anymore anyways."

"Not it's not that," Eri said looking at him. "It's about ..." It was hard to spill out---like a fish bone stuck on her throat---and it hurt. "It's about Kaoru ..."

"Kaoru? So you looked at my messenger."

"Sorry," Eri said, not believing that she was apologizing when he had cheated on her. "But I just ... couldn't resist ..."

"It's alright I don't mind," Takeshi said caressing Eri's neck again. "As I said before, I don't mind you looking at my things because I have nothing to hide."

Eri looked at her boyfriend confused. "You're admitting the conversation with this ... Kaoru and you're still still saying that you have nothing to hide?"

Takeshi grinned. "That's right."

Eri looked at him again. "What's all that about?"

Takeshi hopped up from the sofa, went over to the dark kitchen, and turned off the fire ... his noodles were probably overcooked but he didn't seem to care. He took his extra large chopsticks and began slurping straight from the bowl.

"Kaoru is the manager at the Korean Hot Pot restaurant."

Eri stood up from the sofa. "You're lying."

"I'm not." Takeshi took the pot from the kitchen and sat next to Eri.

Eri who had her arms crossed and squirted away when he did. "She asked you is you finished with everything."

"Yeah, everything at the restaurant---you know cleaning the stuff."

"She asked if you could leave at any time."

"Yeah, I could leave at any time after finishing cleaning."

"She said she couldn't wait for long."

"Yeah," Takeshi said. "She had to close ... she couldn't wait forever for me to put all the stuff into the fridge."

Eri thought about this ... oh, God. Had she misinterpreted everything? "But ... it was at eleven at night ..."

"The time I finish work ... I finishing everything ..."

Eri slumped back into her sofa ... her head spinning around. She couldn't believe it; she had misunderstood everything. She had created a fictitious world that hadn't existed at all. A world she had been certain it existed. Just in a few hours. Physicists were right: words could be created and destroyed---every second.

Eri ran to Takeshi at the kitchen and hugging him while the steam of the noodles surrounded them she said, "I'm sorry ... I shouldn't have doubted you. I shouldn't have checked your conversation."

"It's alright." Takeshi said. "I don't care about your mistakes, but how you deal with them."

Eri nodded, and promised to herself that she would get better at dealing with her mistakes.

That morning, with her mind at peace, Eri sat on her desk finishing the task that she wa*

That night Eri and Takeshi had the good kind of sex that they haven't had in a long time---they even tried new positions aside from the missionary one. On top of Eri, even though Takeshi didn't thrust with the same force as before---probably tired with work---it had the same warm that Eri remembered.
