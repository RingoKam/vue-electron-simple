pain after all is what we remember. What we remember affect our actions. Our actions build who we are.
have Eri delve into the fact that she never picks up the phone

Guong didn't actually see the video which means that De-Shi came to the office after having read the email.

Some people are lovesick, others are sick of love.

"Sunday Bloody Sunday"
I can't believe he news today"
Put this on the epigraph or have someone talk about it.

Eri wonders if De-Shi became obsessed about the video and he's watching it again and again so in a way, he's still trapped in the ruins of the earthquake (he got crazy because of the death of the woman).

Eri felt so relieved from telling someone about the video---someone who had actually listened to her and after that didn't think that she was crazy. And took her seriously. She felt as though she had been floating in space indefinitely and had suddenly grabbed hold of a meteorite that had been floating around. One she had met after an eternity.

"Sunday Bloody Sunday. Sunday Bloody Sunday," he began to sing.

"What was that?" Eri asked.

"A song."

"I know, from who?"

"U2, it's about the Bloody Sunday incident that happened in England. You've heard of it?"

"Eri shook her head."

He tells Eri about the incident.

"So you think the video is a reference to the incident?"

"Maybe it is. Maybe it isn't. Coincidences happen more often that people are willing to admit. We are pattern-wired animals. We hate caos, crave for order."

"Coincidence or not, you know this makes me think that disasters are not only caused by nature. They are million others caused by humans. And ourselves. Blood. Death. Cry."

The trenches dug within our hearts And mothers, children, brothers, sisters

describe more Eri's claustrophobia in the elevator and think of a good reason she takes it (e.g. she wants so overcome her irrational fear. That later becomes rational)

Be yourself, but not around me if I don't like it.

Talk about the colors of stars---about red stars.

De-Shi and the girl describe each other while being buried
--
I can't believe an earthquake saved my life.
 Times never ends when you're suffering---you suffer until the end of times.

[They were alone but had each other. Eri wasn't alone but had no one]
