"Yeah, like doing the same thing with your partner, or who knows once you become a wife or something. Taking care of your children and do all stuff. The bad, boring fucking."

"Well," Eri said, stirring her drink. "Those are very the things that you miss after you lost everything. Get astray. The little boring things." Eri paused to gather her thoughts. "Those are the things that made up your life, that happen long enough to call it a part of your life."

"Well, not for me," Yuki said. "To me, what you call part of your life are the *exceptions*. The remarkable things that happen to you and that you will remember after looking back. After trying to remember what your life was about."

Eri smiled. "We have two opposite definition of life. I wonder how we could share ours."

"Maybe we made up each half a single one. Two pillars that balanced the whole structure."

Eri smiled at Yuki and sipped her drink and stared at it. *And now one of the pillars is going down*. "So that's why you're going to America? To find an *exception* in life?" Eri asked.

"Yeah, that's part of it."

"What's the other part?" Eri asked turning to Yuki.

"Oh, sorry. It's just that I've been so busy with all this packing and registration forms and you know all this." Yuki reddened a bit, it'd been a while since Eri had seen Yuki blushing. "I forgot to tell you that the other reason aside from the excitement and the studies is because I met someone there."

"What?" Eri's eyes widened. "You mean someone? A ... boy? I mean a girl?"

Yuki nodded looking at her glass. "It's not what you think though. It's not that I met her and *then* wanted to go to America. She's just one of the seniors at the university who was helping me to arrange everything. Turns out, she was a lesbian too and you know, we kinda got along when talking on the video calls."

"Oh, I ... see."

"You aren't jealous aren't you?" Yuki said playfully.

"C'mon," Eri said. "You didn't get jealous when I got with together with Takeshi."

"Actually I did." Eri said in an half-mocking half-serious tone.

"Really?" Eri said in a joking tone.

"Yeah, the bastard was taking away the only friend that I had. And I thought that you would change and reduce the time that you would see me."

"But I didn't ..." Eri said.

"Yeah you didn't," Yuki said placing her hand on Eri's and smiling a warm smile.

"So tell me," Eri said suddenly changing her mood. "Who's this girl?"

"She's a volunteer in the Office of International Affairs. Her major is Chinese, so she thought it would be a great chance to do a cultural exchange. But as it turned out we ended up exchanging more than that, more than cultural barrier." Yuki laughed.

Eri laughed too. "So what do you like about her?"

Yuki laughed. "You sound like my dad asking me about my new date. Well, I don't know. We just have this connection you know. Like when you talk with someone you barely know and just feel at home. As though you've known each other for years. Some couples don't even get to that by being together for ten years."

Eri nodded. "Or maybe once they felt like that and the familiarity faded."

"That's right," Yuki said.

Eri stared at her glass, wondering if she was feeling jealous. And maybe just like Yuki she was a little bit. But it was different from Yuki. This time Yuki *would* reduce the time that she would spend with her. Almost to zero. Well they could still talk on the phone and even have video calls like with that girl; but it wouldn't be the same; they wouldn't be able to be face to face together, hearing each other's voices that aren't filtered by a device. Besides, Eri had the feeling---just a feeling that Yuki would be too *occupied* for her.

*Everyone is leaving me for somebody else.*

"Hey," Yuki suddenly said. "You feeling alright? Still in the city?" She waved her palm in front of Eri.

"Yeah, no, yes." Eri massaged her temples. "It's just that I still can't believe you're going to the US."

"You seem to be very cool with it the first time I told you," Yuki remarked.

"Yeah," Eri said touching her temple. "Sometimes I'm slow to react."

"Yeah I've noticed that," Yuki said mockingly. "Sometimes you feel stuff after it had happened. Like an aftershocks."

"Talking about aftershocks, I forgot to tell you something. About the earthquake, and a tape ..."

"C'mon Eri, all you do is to talk about that earthquake. I know it was scary but it's that; it's the past. It's not here anymore."

"Well, maybe it's trembling it is," Eri remarked.

"Look you need to relax. To stop thinking about Takeshi. About earthquakes. You should." Yuki peeked past Eri. "You should meet some guys like those."

Eri turned around. Two guys sat behind them. One stocky but elegant one with a suit and who smelled with an excess of cologne and other nerdy but handsome one. Not that he was wearing glasses or was wearing a shirt or an anime T-shirt. In fact, he looked normal, almost plain. It was just the feeling that he gave to Eri.

"Have you lost your mind?" Eri said.

"Losing one's mind is sometimes the right thing to do," Yuki said.

Eri turned to Yuki reproachful. "Now you're the one who doesn't have the feet on the ground."

"Don't you worry so much Eri. Dancing isn't cheating after all."

"But it's the step before ..."

"You're really talking like the mature women now."

Eri let out a sigh. "Okay, okay. But I'm not gonna dance. You hear me? Just talk."

"Got it," and with that Yuki grabbed Eri and went towards the guys.

"Hey, hi," Yuki said, suddenly exhibiting an unusual amount of femininity, "We know that you guys want to talk with us. And we thought that it would be nice to not to waste your precious time and we decided that it would be good to cut the chase of your hesitation and just come us in the first time."

"Well," said the stocky guys. "Thanks. You're very considerate."

"Actually, I have a boyfriend and my friend has a girlfriend," Eri suddenly said.

"Could you give me a minute." Yuki turned to Eri. "Hey, c'mon," Yuki whispered to Eri. "Remeber, may the the last time we come here, do this. Let's just have a little bit of fun. As the guy said, dancing *isn't* cheating. Besides, remember. Look for the *exceptions* in life." And with that Yuki held the stocky guy's hand---as though having made up her mind---and dragged him to the dance floor. All the while the nerdy guy stood there in silence like a sentinel.

Eri stood there for a moment baffled, wondering what she should do.

Both girls laughed and then Yuki asked her Eri to wait for a bit for her to pack the last things that were left; mainly her shoes and dildo collection. As Eri watched her friend she looked around the place. And only then she realized the it was unrecognizibable: everything was empty like a house when you first move in. (Maybe she had been so focused on the issue with Chai that she had forgotten to look around.) The whole place was just empty white walls, and empty vanilla floor, and empty tables. Only then it occurred to Eri that this place would never be the same. It would never be the home of her best friend.
